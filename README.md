# Human-in-the-loop workflows with Prefect

This repository contains examples of how to use Prefect with human-in-the-loop (HITL) workflows.

HITL workflows are workflows that require human intervention to complete.

Prefect allows you to pause a flow run to wait for human input in the UI and then resume the flow run.
